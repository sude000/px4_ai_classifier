# ==========================================
# 1. PATH CONFIGURATION
# ==========================================
# The root directory where the scaled data is saved
DATA_DIR = "./data"

# Exact paths to the scaled Train, Val, and Test CSVs generated in Phase 3

# 2. DATA LOADER & ROLLING WINDOW PARAMETERS
# ==========================================
# WINDOW_SIZE: The number of sequential rows (timesteps) the model looks at to make 1 prediction.
# At 100Hz, a window of 50 equals 0.5 seconds of flight data.
WINDOW_SIZE = 50

# STEP_SIZE: How many rows to slide the window forward.
# E.g., if step=10, Window 1 is rows 0-49, Window 2 is rows 10-59.
# Smaller step size = more overlapping training data, but higher RAM usage.
STEP_SIZE = 10

# BATCH_SIZE: How many windows to feed into the Neural Network at once during training.
# Standard values: 32, 64, 128. Reduce this if you get Out Of Memory (OOM) errors.
BATCH_SIZE = 64

# NUM_WORKERS: How many CPU threads to use for loading data in PyTorch.
# Set to 0 if you encounter multi-processing errors on Windows/Mac.
NUM_WORKERS = 4


# ==========================================
# 3. COLUMNS TO IGNORE DURING TRAINING
# ==========================================
# These columns exist in the CSV for structural reasons (like grouping flights),
# but MUST NOT be fed into the Neural Network as features (X).
COLUMNS_TO_DROP = ['%time', 'flight_id', 'target_label']
