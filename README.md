A Deep Learning-based MVP system that automatically detects and classifies mechanical failures by analyzing flight logs from fixed-wing UAVs.

## Project Architecture
This project focuses on identifying 6 different flight states (Normal + 5 Fault Types) using PyTorch, processing multi-sensor temporal data (IMU, GPS, Actuators).

The data pipeline and training logic are modularized:
*   `data/data_bulding/`: Scripts to aggregate and clean raw drone logs (e.g., `merge_asof`).
*   `data/preprossing/`: Correlation analysis, missing value patching, and Stratified Group splitting.
*   `src/`: PyTorch Deep Learning architecture.
    *   `config.py`: Centralized hyperparameters.
    *   `dataloader/`: PyTorch Dataset and rolling window logic.
    *   `models/`: CNN, LSTM, and Hybrid architectures.
    *   `train.py`: Local training engine.
    *   `train_modal.py`: Cloud training orchestration (Modal).
*   `training_results/`: Locally downloaded models, learning curves, and confusion matrices.

## Labeling Map
*   `0`: Normal / No Failure
*   `1`: Engine Failure
*   `2`: Elevator Failure
*   `3`: Rudder Failure
*   `4`: Aileron Failure
*   `5`: Multi-Fault

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Data Pipeline
To regenerate the Train/Val/Test splits from raw data:
```bash
uv run data/data_bulding/build_clean_dataset.py
uv run data/data_bulding/build_master_dataset.py
uv run data/preprossing/preprocess_and_split.py
```

### 2. Training on the Cloud (Modal)
We use [Modal](https://modal.com/) to train models on high-performance A10G GPUs. This command trains all architectures (CNN, LSTM, Hybrid) and automatically downloads the results.

```bash
uv run modal run src/train_modal.py --model all
```
*Note: Results are saved to a Modal Volume and then synced to your local `training_results/` folder.*

### 3. Evaluating Results
To compare the performance of all trained models locally on the test set:
```bash
uv run evaluate_all.py
```

### 4. Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit App)
We provide a web-based dashboard to visualize the AI model's real-time predictions on raw flight logs. 

To launch the dashboard:
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

**How to use and understand the App:**
1. **Upload Data:** Upload a raw ROS bag telemetry `.csv` file via the sidebar.
2. **AI Inference:** The Hybrid AI model instantly processes the flight using a 0.5s sliding window.
3. **Prediction Table:** A detailed table lists every time-slice where a failure was detected, providing the exact timestamp, fault type (e.g., Engine, Rudder), and the model's Confidence %.
4. **Vibration Analysis (FFT):** The "Raw Signal Analysis" section lets you select any sensor group (like IMU or Power) to view its Spectral Analysis (FFT). You can move the Time Range slider to isolate the exact moment of a failure and watch the vibration peaks (Hz) shift in real-time, verifying the AI's diagnosis mathematically.

## Final Model Comparison
After training and rigorous evaluation, the following results were achieved:

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🏆 HYBRID** | **74.80%** | **0.7485** | **Recommended** |
| **CNN** | 73.98% | 0.7439 | Strong Baseline |
| **LSTM** | 52.85% | 0.6200 | Temporal Baseline |

The **Hybrid (CNN+LSTM)** model is the final choice, providing the best balance between detecting sharp sensor anomalies and understanding long-term flight trends.

## 🏆 Best Model: HYBRID - Performance Analysis

The Hybrid model achieved the highest performance by effectively capturing both high-frequency vibration patterns (via CNN layers) and long-term temporal dependencies (via LSTM layers).

### Training Logs (Learning Curves)
![Hybrid Learning Curves](training_results/hybrid_learning_curves.png)
*The training logs show steady convergence. The model successfully learned complex patterns without significant overfitting.*

### Confusion Matrix
![Hybrid Confusion Matrix](training_results/hybrid_cm.png)
*The confusion matrix demonstrates strong classification performance across most failure modes.*

### Detailed Metrics: HYBRID
| Metric | Performance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Test Accuracy** | 74.80% |
| **Test F1-Score** | 0.7485 |
| **Training Device** | NVIDIA A10G (Cloud) |
| **Architecture** | 1D-CNN + LSTM Hybrid |

## Running Tests
To verify that the dataset and dataloaders are functioning correctly:
```bash
uv run tests/test_pipeline.py
uv run src/dataloader/dataset.py
```
